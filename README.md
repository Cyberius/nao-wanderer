nao-wanderer
============

Application for the NAO humanoid robot that makes it explore a space and
construct a map of its environment. Currently it's in a very basic state.

TODO
----
* Decide on a format to use for the map. Quadtrees currently seem like a
reasonable choice.
* Write python code to generate the map from the set of waypoints currently
generated by the robot.
* Attempt to determine any "slippage" between where the robot thinks it is
and where it actually is - for example by using vision to track perceived
movement of landmarks.
* Add a Javascript widget to the project so that the current map produced
by NAO can be viewed from Aldebaran's "my NAO" page
